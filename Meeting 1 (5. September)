Research discussions and task distributions 

On this online meeting we decided to to do research on general what is the purpose of battery management system and  what modules our BMS is going to have. 

Itâ€™s agreed that everyone will take one of the modules like, cell balancing, temperature measuring, current control, and switching from charging to discharging and other way around and dig deeper how one can be implemented.
